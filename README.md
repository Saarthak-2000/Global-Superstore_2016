I created a Power BI dashboard using the "global_superstore_2016" dataset from the internet. The dataset, in CSV format with three sheets ('Orders', 'People', and 'Returns'), was uploaded to Power BI. Employing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), I modified the data and established relationships between sheets in the model tab. This enabled effective analysis and visualization of key findings and patterns in the Power BI dashboard.
